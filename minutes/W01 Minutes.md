Group Decisions/Updates:
 - Learned that our group's parts have already been ordered, and we are waiting to get a receipt and for parts to come in.
 - Decided to bring a group member's Raspberry Pi to class so we could start working on establishing a Bluetooth connection between the microcontroller and a mobile device.
