Group Decisions:
-	Decided to use GPS locations for how the robot will navigate to the user’s cell phone instead of Bluetooth signaling.
 - Decided to use Bluetooth to communicate the device’s GPS location to the robot.


Important if you are establishing a connection to the Raspberry Pi:
-	Plug in the HDMI connections for the keyboard and mouse, then the connection to the monitor first. Make sure the monitor is connected to the HDMI port (the bottom right button on the monitor changes the port and can easily be hit on accident).
-	SD card is in the Raspberry Pi, do not remove this unless necessary (or while the Raspberry Pi is powered on)
-	After these connections are all plugged in, connect the power cord the Raspberry Pi. If the switch is off, flip the switch on. DO NOT TOUCH the switch or power off while booting or while the Raspberry Pi is on (could corrupt the SD card).
-	Wait for a while for the image to show up on the monitor. If “No Signal” is showing on the monitor for several minutes, check the monitor is connected to the correct port again (bottom right button).
-	The Raspberry Pi OS should be on the screen now.
-	If “No signal” shows up while Raspberry Pi is on, move mouse, it was just left idle for too long/fell asleep.
-	For shut down: Go to the top left corner of the screen, click “Log out”, then click “Shut down”. Wait for the screen to be either off or to show “No signal”. THEN the switch on the power cord can be switched to off to shut down the Raspberry Pi (this order is to not corrupt the SD card).
