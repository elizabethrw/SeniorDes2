Group Decisions:
 - Mobile trash bin base design is so the base and receptacle of the robot are the same instead of separate.  
 - Delay Action 48 from 2023-10-17 to 2023-11-9
 - Delay Action 47 from 2023-10-17 to 2023-10-31
 - Task 86 is OBE since GPS working means not allowing Bluetooth usage (will use internet to connect to the raspberry pi).
