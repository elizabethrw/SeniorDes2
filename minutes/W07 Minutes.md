Actions Decided (Artifacts are added as tasks are completed):
| ID | Date Assigned | Assignee | Description | Due Date | Completion Date or OBE | Artifact |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 081 | 2023-10-17 | Elizabeth | Bring purchased voltage booster to lab. | 2023-10-17 | 2023-10-17 | Voltage booster is in locker of lab. |
| 082 | 2023-10-17 | Elizabeth | Identify source for how to write code that parses latitude and longitude from GPS from /dev/ttyAMA0. | 2023-10-19 | 2023-10-17 | https://sparklers-the-makers.github.io/blog/robotics/use-neo-6m-module-with-raspberry-pi/ |
| 083 | 2023-10-17 | Christopher | Solder wires onto new Boost Board. | 2023-10-17 | 2023-10-17 | Wires are now soldered, appears to have good contact and no shorts. |
| 084 | 2023-10-17 | Christopher | Test output of new Boost Board. | 2023-10-17 | 2023-10-17 | Output appears to not work unless it’s actually hooked up to something, so will need to test it with the RasPi. |
| 085 | 2023-10-17 | Ji | Glue part of the receptacle to the base | 2023-10-19 | 2023-10-19 | Part of the receptacle was glued to the base. |
| 086 | 2023-10-17 | Yahia | Parse bluetooth input at raspberry pi. | 2023-10-26 | OBE | OBE |
| 087 | 2023-10-17 | Christopher | Test if Boost Board will power Rasp Pi. | 2023-10-17 | 2023-10-17 | Raspberry Pi successfully boots with battery and Boost Board. |
| 088 | 2023-10-17 | Christopher | Test if Proximity sensor outputs reasonable output | 2023-10-17 | 2023-10-17 | Proximity sensor outputs larger numbers for larger distances and smaller numbers for smaller distances, so it works. |
| 089 | 2023-10-17 | Elizabeth | Write code that will output latitude and longitude of raspberry pi. | 2023-10-31 | 2023-10-26 | "goodGPS.py” is on the raspberry pi and outputs latitude and longitude. |
| 090 | 2023-10-17 | Elizabeth | Write code that will have robot move forward, stop in front of object, and get around the object then stop (w/o GPS). | 2023-11-9 | 2023-10-26 | “aroundObjectNoGPS.py” is on the raspberry pi (not yet tested due to robot not yet being assembled). |
| 091 | 2023-10-19 | Jacob | Identify resource for coding robot to move around an object. | 2023-10-19 | 2023-10-19 | https://docs.idew.org/code-robotics/references/robot-behaviors/detecting-objects |
| 092 | 2023-10-19 | Elizabeth | Get pieces cut out of front and side pieces of robot (for proximity sensor, camera, lid motor) | 2023-10-31 | 2023-10-24 | Brought the front and side pieces with cut outs to lab. |
| 093 | 2023-10-19 | Christopher | Test if Battery can run RasPi and all 5 motors at the same time | 2023-10-19 | 2023-10-19 | Ran everything together, so everything does work off of the battery. |
| 094 | 2023-10-19 | Elizabeth | Test “testMotorsForBack.py” script with Pi and motors hooked up to battery. | 2023-10-19 | 2023-10-19 | All motors spun in the right directions for each action, so it works correctly. |
| 095 | 2023-10-19 | Elizabeth | Write W07 Minutes on GitHub. | 2023-10-26 | 2023-10-24 | Link: https://github.com/elizabethrw/SeniorDes2/blob/main/minutes/W07%20Minutes.md |

Group Decisions:
 - Mobile trash bin base design is so the base and receptacle of the robot are the same instead of separate.
 - Delay Action 48 from 2023-10-17 to 2023-11-9
 - Delay Action 47 from 2023-10-17 to 2023-10-31
